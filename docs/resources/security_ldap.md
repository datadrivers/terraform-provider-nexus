- `connection_timeout_seconds` (Number) How long to wait before timeout
- `group_type` (String) Defines a type of groups used: static (a group contains a list of users) or dynamic (a user contains a list of groups). Required if ldapGroupsAsRoles is true. This must be set in upper case.

- `auth_realm` (String) The SASL realm to bind to. Required if authScheme is CRAM_MD5 or DIGEST_MD5
- `group_base_dn` (String) The relative DN where group objects are found (e.g. ou=Group). This value will have the Search base DN value appended to form the full Group search base DN.

- `user_id_attribute` (String) This is used to find a user given its user ID
- `user_ldap_filter` (String) LDAP search filter to limit user search
- `user_member_of_attribute` (String) Set this to the attribute used to store the attribute which holds groups DN in the user object. Required if groupType is dynamic
